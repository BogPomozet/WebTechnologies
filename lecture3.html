                <q>HTML alone is really great, but pretty ugly. CSS gives us a way to improve how the elements of our
                    pages are presented</q>

                <h2>HTML , CSS, & JS</h2>

                <p>HTML gives us structure (which is essential). CSS gives us presentation buy not just making things
                    look pretty
                    but also important to usability & accessibility. Presentation from a technical perspective
                </p>

                <h2>HTML</h2>

                <p>Early HTML had mixed content and presentation: every element needed font, colour, style, alignment,
                    border,
                    size, etc. explicitly described, often repeatedly so throughout. It needed a consistent & flexible
                    way to control presentation:
                    enter CSS. Moving style declarations gives simpler HTML and more manageable design.
                </p>

                <h2>CONTENT & PRESENTATION</h2>

                <p>Visual & design aspects separated from the core content & structure of the document. Same as a human
                    body css is a skeleton gives structure and html gives appearance as a flash.
                </p>

                <p>Different members of a team can work on each aspect. People with visual impairment can provide their
                    own stylesheets to the browser to override the website developer’s decisions. Screen & Print
                    versions of pages can be styled differently - tailor content to the medium of consumption.
                </p>

                <p>You can’t design something well until you have some idea of what the design is working with - you
                    need some content (or at least an idea of the structure of the content). Content can drive the
                    design process this is why we started with HTML and thinking about Data before getting to CSS.
                </p>
                
                <h2>CASCADING STYLE SHEETS (CSS)</h2>

                <p>A Declarative, domain-specific, text-based, page appearance description programming language that is
                    flexible and robust way to share information, primarily as documents, across many platforms. It can
                    be:
                    <li> Declarative (implicit control flow) - say what we want & the computer tries to achieve that (&
                        other thinks might happen (e.g. increase font-size & the associated container will grow
                        automatically)</li>
                    <li> Resilient - If browser can’t do what you declare in CSS then the site (generally) continues to
                        function</li>
                    <li> Permits almost every HTML tag to be arbitrarily scaled, positioned, & decorated - overcomes
                        limitations of underlying markup language</li>
                </p>

                <h2>CSS DESIGN CONSTRAINTS</h2>

                <p>
                    <li>Applies styling & layout to HTML elements - can paint border around HTML element but cannot
                        create in pure CSS</li>
                    <li>Layouts of content that can adjust to any screen/viewport/canvas on any platform</li>
                    <li>Text that scales independently of viewport - scaling font should lead to reflow of page not to
                        horizontal scrolling</li>
                    <li>User can override anything regardless of what the designer thinks or intends</li>
                    <li>Progressive rendering - layout depends on previous content(but not future content) - but loading
                        new content might force a reflow of previously rendered content</li>
                </p>

                <h2>BOX MODEL</h2>

                <img src="lecture3(1).png" width="700px" height="500px" />
                
                <p>Each element of a web page has several boxes associated with it that affect spacing & placement:
                    <li>Padding - distance between edge of element and it’s content </li>
                    <li>Border - frontier between padding and margin</li>
                    <li>Margin - distance between edge of element and adjacent element</li>
                    <li>padding, border, & margin divided into four edges: top, bottom, left, & right: border-left,
                        border-right, border-top and border-bottom. Same for margin and padding…</li>
                    <li>Borders can be applied to all edges or to individual edges. Characteristics: {solid, dotted,
                        dashed, double}</li>
