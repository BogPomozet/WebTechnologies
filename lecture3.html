                <q>HTML alone is really great, but pretty ugly. CSS gives us a way to improve how the elements of our
                    pages are presented</q>
                <h2>HTML , CSS, & JS</h2>
                <p>HTML gives us structure (which is essential). CSS gives us presentation buy not just making things
                    look pretty
                    but also important to usability & accessibility. Presentation from a technical perspective</p>
                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>Early HTML had mixed content and presentation: every element needed font, colour, style, alignment,
                    border,
                    size, etc. explicitly described, often repeatedly so throughout. It needed a consistent & flexible
                    way to control presentation:
                    enter CSS. Moving style declarations gives simpler HTML and more manageable design.
                </p>
                <h2>CONTENT & PRESENTATION</h2>
                <p>Visual & design aspects separated from the core content & structure of the document. Same as a human
                    body css is a skeleton gives structure and html gives appearance as a flash.
                </p>
                <p>Different members of a team can work on each aspect. People with visual impairment can provide their
                    own stylesheets to the browser to override the website developer’s decisions. Screen & Print
                    versions of pages can be styled differently - tailor content to the medium of consumption.</p>
                <p>You can’t design something well until you have some idea of what the design is working with - you
                    need some content (or at least an idea of the structure of the content). Content can drive the
                    design process this is why we started with HTML and thinking about Data before getting to CSS.</p>
