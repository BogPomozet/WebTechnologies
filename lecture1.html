                <h2>THE WEB</h2>
                <p>The Web was designed for ease of publication - non-programmer should be able to develop & deploy
                    Web-sites. To achieve this browsers have traditionally been very accommodating in what they will
                    accept.
                    HTML is generally processed by Web browsers.</p>

                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>HyperText Markup Language is a standard markup languagefor turning text into hypertext by using
                    markup
                    (perhaps the most dominant way of creating hypertext). Not a programming language because has no
                    support
                    for programming constructs.
                    HTML is a part of the triad of foundational web technologies (alongside CSS & Javascript). It
                    describes
                    the semantic structure of the data, which CSS presents, and Javascript manipulates. Browser receives
                    HTML document from server or storage. Document is then rendered visually (other user agents may use
                    the
                    returned HTML in other ways).
                    Plain text can be written HTML in any text editor and only need to save it as a .html document
                    (which
                    can then be opened in a browser).
                    HTML is a language that has a syntactic structure that can be verified as correct (or otherwise). It
                    also has semantics (meaning). There are tools to automatically verify that a given HTML document is
                    correct (or otherwise): <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C</a>.
                    HTML has mixed structure and presentation (e.g. font face & font size, colour, size of elements,
                    etc.).
                    Until 4.01 defined the visual presentation of a web page. But modern HTML describes the content,
                    it’s
                    structure, and it’s relation to other content. Visual presentation of those things is delegated to
                    CSS.
                    As you investigate various web pages you will notice considerable variation amongst versions of
                    HTML.
                    Developers should write HTML to the current version, e.g. HTML 5, but they should be aware of what
                    earlier versions looked like for better understanding.
                </p>

                <h2>W3C</h2>
                <p>World Wide Web Consortium defines the standards for the web( e.g. HTML 4.0 that is based on Standard
                    Generalised Markup Language (SGML) or HTML 5 that is backwards compatible but no longer based on
                    SGML)
                    and various related standards: XHTML 1.0, 1.0, 2 (cancelled) based on eXtensible Markup Language
                    (XML).
                    You might see any or all of these versions and related languages whilst working with hypertext
                    systems -
                    we don’t always get to build new stuff from scratch in the latest versions. The W3C also does a lot
                    more
                    than just define core web standards.</p>

                <h2>HTML ELEMENTS</h2>
                <p>HTML documents are constructed from HTML Elements that are keywords encapsulated within angle
                    brackets, e.g. <-html->. Elements are represented using opening and closing tags, e.g. <-html->
                            <- /html->. Most tags delineate the start & end of a portion of text or enclose other sets
                                of tags so
                                often paired - one for each end. Some stand alone amongst the text, e.g.<br />
                                All use angle brackets and are combined to create structured documents by denoting
                                structural
                                semantics for the text (such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, etc.)
